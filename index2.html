        <li>USA has a very unique style for approving visa, especially Non-Immigrants Visa like Visitor, Student and L1</li>
	<li>Very Different from Other Countries of the world</li>
	<li>While, I am still not able to predict US Consular officers 100%; I know what they are looking for in an application and in Applicant(s)</li>
	<li>You can do 95% yourself; BUT our extra edge of 5% makes a lot of difference. Race may be lost by a very small fraction of a second.</li> 
	<li>These days US Embassies in India have a long waiting for about a year for Visitor Visa. 
	 We do not charge a single rupee extra (apart from our regular consultation fee) if our staff can bring an early appointment for you. Please note, we try from our side, but WE DONOT Guarantee an Early appointment.
